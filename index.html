                                    drew on several sources for my initial research. Online articles and videos.
                                    Rideshare has been around for years,but autonomous rideshare is very new. Waymo is
                                    the only operating autonomous rideshare system at this time. <br /><br />I viewed
                                    videos of people using waymo as well as referencing written articles. The Waymo
                                    videos and articles were well curated, so I decided to look at peoples first
                                    responses to riding / driving in a Tesla with autopilot engaged.Uber and Lyft are
                                    the main competitors, their user experiences and app UIs follow close to the same
                                    pattern.  <br /><br />To help delight and engage the user and be comforting, as well
                                    as follow Tesla’s current fun UI elements.  Which include several modes, such as
                                    Mars mode.</div>

                                <h3>User and App Flow</h3>
                                <p>The high level user and app flow are combined in this flow chart. I discovered that
                                    unlike a rideshare
                                    service with a driver, there would need to be a function if there were an emergency
                                    with the passenger
                                    or they remained in the vehicle after the drop off. The solution is illustrated in
                                    the flow chart below,
                                    allowing a customer service rep to assist if there&#x27;s an issue with the rider.

                            user seemed a little unsure and took some time to identify and verbalize destination
                            location<br />‍<strong>2) Change drop-off location </strong>User thought destination would
                            be changed by dragging and dropping, but was designed to be a click to
                            change.<br />‍<strong>3) Identify meaning of time under pickup location </strong>User was
                            able to identify correctly that it was the time to pick up<br /><br /><strong>Testing

                                    experience is the motion design element we integrated. This isn&#x27;t just for
                                    aesthetic appeal; it adds a touch of magic to the user journey. More importantly,
                                    this dynamic motion design informs the user about the specific type and appearance
                                    of the Tesla Robotaxi they are choosing. Our aim was to merge functionality with

        <p>I am a passionate front-end developer with a keen eye for usability and a flair for harmonizing form with
            function. Just as I weave emotions into melodies as a singer-songwriter, I meticulously craft every digital
            interface to ensure it not only looks appealing but feels intuitive. Drawing from a diverse palette of
            musical genres, I approach each project with the same eclecticism, ensuring that every user experience is as
            harmonious and unique as a carefully composed song.</p>
        <p>Beyond the digital world, my love for road trips and mountain biking reflects my adventurous spirit and
            desire to explore new terrains, both physically and in the realm of design. Whether I'm immersed in a
            captivating movie, pedaling through rugged trails, or simply observing the world around me, I never miss an
            opportunity to identify and muse on usability aspects. This innate curiosity propels my work, pushing me to
            continuously enhance the UI and interactions to create experiences that resonate deeply with users.</p>[
