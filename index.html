                    <strong>Iteration</strong>
                    <p>In this version the contrast of the "Days / Hours Until Expiration" background was increased and the color changed to red. Giving the two visual indicators more visual weight.</p>
                    <p><strong>Recorded Video Session&nbsp;2<br /></strong>A&nbsp;user was given tasks and asked to edit the first flight on Monday.<br />The user was able to quickly go through the process flow and complete the task successfully, validating the new task flow.</p>
                    <p>Ideally additional tests should be performed to validate the solution and find any usability issues.</p>

                                    drew on several sources for my initial research. Online articles and videos.
                                    Rideshare has been around for years, but autonomous rideshare is very new. Waymo is
                                    the only operating autonomous rideshare system at this time. <br /><br />I viewed
                                    videos of people using waymo as well as referencing written articles. The Waymo
                                    videos and articles were well curated, so I decided to look at peoples first
                                    responses to riding / driving in a Tesla with autopilot engaged.Uber and Lyft are
                                    the main competitors, their user experiences and app UIs follow close to the same
                                    pattern.  <br /><br />To help delight and engage the user and be comforting, as well
                                    as follow Tesla’s current fun UI elements.  Which include several modes, such as
                                    Mars mode.</div>

                                <h3>User and App Flow</h3>
                                <p>The high level user and app flow are combined in this flow chart. I discovered that
                                    unlike a rideshare
                                    service with a driver, there would need to be a function if there were an emergency
                                    with the passenger
                                    or they remained in the vehicle after the drop off. The solution is illustrated in
                                    the flow chart below,
                                    allowing a customer service rep to assist if there&#x27;s an issue with the rider.

                    <h1>User Journey</h1>
                    <p>‍<strong>‍</strong>1) Emily wakes up at 7am ready for the day<br />2) She goes to start her
                        car, but it will not start and she has a morning meeting<br />3) She thinks about getting a
                        rideshare but is hesitant because of experiences with bad and unfriendly drivers in the
                        past<br />4) She has heard about the new autonomous rideshare service from Tesla and decides
                        to give it a try<br />5) She downloads and opens the app and selects her
                        destination<br />6) Car arrives right on time and she is pleased with her choice<br />7) She
                        completes the trip and has a pleasant interaction with the app and was happy with her
                        interaction<br /><br />‍</p>

                    <h3>Wireframes</h3>
                    <p>Mid-fi wireframes are my exploration of vehicle selection. The goals were to make the
                        interactions
                        delightful and usable at the same time. The initial vehicle selection screen used a carousel UI.
                        I
                        decided to go with a list and a visual element because all selections could be viewed at once.
                         Saving
                        the user time and effort.</p>

                        <div class="image-featured">
                            <img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5a51b60f30cd7400011b014f/5ec6bec8d57824200625d482_mocks-overview.jpg" alt="" />
                        <div>Select wireframes of home screen and evolution of vehicle selection screen.</div></div>

                    <p>I was initially going to use a carousel UI for the vehicle selection, but this would not allow
                        the user
                        to view all of the options at one glance. I iterated to a carousel display for the vehicle image
                        display, but also included a text navigation to allow the user to view all options at once, and
                        easily
                        navigate between the cars. The carousel also allows for navigation, providing two ways for the
                        users to
                        make their selection.</p>
                    <h3>Prototypes</h3>
                    <p>My main focus of this project was the vehicle selection screen, the initial prototype <a

                    <div class="image-featured">

                        <p class="paragraph-2">With this UI the users are not only provided with a
                            seamless experience but also an intuitive one. They are able to easily select their
                            preferred Robotaxi vehicle without any hassles. But what truly elevates this user
                            experience is the motion design element I integrated. This isn&#x27;t just for
                            aesthetic appeal; it adds a touch of magic to the user journey. More importantly,
                            this dynamic motion design informs the user about the specific type and appearance
                            of the Tesla Robotaxi they are choosing. My aim was to merge functionality with
                            delight, ensuring users are both informed and engaged throughout the vehicle selection
                            process.<br /></p>

        <p>I am a passionate front-end developer with a keen eye for usability and a flair for harmonizing form with
            function. Just as I weave emotions into melodies as a singer-songwriter, I meticulously craft every digital
            interface to ensure it not only looks appealing but feels intuitive. Drawing from a diverse palette of
            musical genres, I approach each project with the same eclecticism, ensuring that every user experience is as
            harmonious and unique as a carefully composed song.</p>
        <p>Beyond the digital world, my love for road trips and mountain biking reflects my adventurous spirit and
            desire to explore new terrains, both physically and in the realm of design. Whether I'm immersed in a
            captivating movie, pedaling through rugged trails, or simply observing the world around me, I never miss an
            opportunity to identify and muse on usability aspects. This innate curiosity propels my work, pushing me to
            continuously enhance the UI and interactions to create experiences that resonate deeply with users.</p>[
